<h5>Best Face Sunscreen:</h5>
<br>
<br>
<p>We haven't stopped raving about this affordable foundation since it was released—it's just that good! We love that you only need a few pumps to cover your entire face, so it's a sulit purchase for sure.</P>

<p>Before anything else, we just want to remind everyone that we still need to wear sunscreen, even if we're mostly indoors. UV rays can get through the windows so you will need protection! We recommend this face sunscreen from Vaseline because it also soothes skin from exposure to heat.</p>
